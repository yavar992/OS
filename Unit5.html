-----------ethical human conflict explain in terms of values and policies and character ----------\
Ethical Human Conflict
Ethical human conflict happens when people disagree because of different beliefs about what is right or wrong, different rules they have to follow, or different personal traits.

Key Parts:
1. Values:

What They Are: Values are the personal beliefs about what is important or right. Conflicts can occur when people have different values.
Example: One person values honesty, so they always tell the truth, while another person values loyalty and doesn’t want to reveal a friend’s secret. This can lead to conflict if telling the truth means breaking the friend’s trust.
2. Policies:

What They Are: Policies are official rules or guidelines that people need to follow in organizations or societies. Conflicts can arise if people have different views on these rules.
Example: If a company policy says you must report any wrongdoing, but an employee feels uncomfortable reporting a colleague because they are friends, this creates a conflict between following the rule and maintaining the friendship.
3. Character:

What It Is: Character includes a person’s moral qualities, like honesty or fairness. Conflicts can happen if people have different personal traits.
Example: A strict person who always follows rules might clash with someone who bends the rules to get things done faster. Their different characters lead to disagreements.
Simple Examples:
At Work:

Situation: An employee sees a coworker cheating on expenses. The rule says to report cheating, but the employee doesn’t want to because they like their coworker.
Conflict: The employee struggles between following the company’s rule (honesty) and not wanting to hurt their coworker (loyalty).
In Medicine:

Situation: A doctor needs to decide if they should tell a patient they have a serious illness. The rule says to be honest, but the doctor worries it will upset the patient.
Conflict: The doctor faces a choice between being truthful (honesty) and protecting the patient’s feelings (compassion).
In Law:

Situation: A lawyer has to defend a client even if they think the client might be guilty. The lawyer has to balance their job responsibility with their personal feelings.
Conflict: The lawyer’s duty (defend the client) conflicts with their personal beliefs about the client’s guilt.
Summary:
Ethical Human Conflict is when people disagree because of different values (what’s important to them), policies (rules they follow), or character (personal traits).
It helps to understand these differences to resolve conflicts and find solutions that respect everyone involved.
